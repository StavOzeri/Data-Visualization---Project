## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
part1 <- read.csv("C:/Users/Niv Dolev/Downloads/ai_job_trends_dataset.csv")
summary(part1)
names_of_companies <- unique(part1$Experience.Required..Years.)
print(names_of_companies)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
part2 <- read.csv("C:/Users/Niv Dolev/Downloads/Enterprise_GenAI_Adoption_Impact.csv")
summary(part2)
names_of_countries <- unique(part2$GenAI.Tool)
print(names_of_countries)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
