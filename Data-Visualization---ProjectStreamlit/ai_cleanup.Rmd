```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load the dplyr package (part of tidyverse) to use bind_rows()
library(dplyr)

# 1. Read the first dataset (assuming files are in the working directory)
part1 <- read.csv("ai_job_dataset.csv")

# 2. Read the second dataset
part2 <- read.csv("ai_job_dataset1.csv")

# 3. Combine the two datasets vertically by stacking rows
# bind_rows aligns columns by name and fills missing cells with NA
combined_file <- bind_rows(part1, part2)

# Display the first few rows of the combined dataset for verification
head(combined_file)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(combined_file)
colnames(combined_file)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
names_of_companies <- unique(combined_file$company_name)
print(names_of_companies)
### 30,000 lines and only 16 companies is weird 
```

```{r head, echo=FALSE}
# 1. Calculate the counts for each unique company name
company_counts <- combined_file %>%
  # Group the data by the column you want to count (company_name)
  group_by(company_name) %>%
  # Summarize the group by counting the number of rows in each group
  summarise(Count = n())

# 2. Get the total number of lines (rows) in the combined dataset
total_lines <- nrow(combined_file)

# 3. Print the results clearly
cat("--- Company Counts ---\n")
print(company_counts)

cat("\n--- Total Lines in Dataset ---\n")
print(total_lines)
### 3 of the 16 companies are not real and their names look fake although it shouldn't matter
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
